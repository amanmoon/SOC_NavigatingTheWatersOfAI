The ‘data.csv’ file has data pertaining to auto loans for the reporting month of Dec’22. Each row is a unique auto loan,
and each column is an attribute of that loan. Detailed description of attributes is available in ‘data_dictionary.txt’ file.
Using python and relevant packages, attempt the following questions:
1) Using columns originationDate and loanTerm, calculate the maturityDate for each loan
maturityDate = originationDate + loanTerm
2) Calculate remaining term in months
3) Which State (col: obligorState) has the second highest percentage of loans, by:
a. Loan count
b. Loan amount
4) Calculate the share of used vehicle loans originated in each month, as a percentage of all loans originated in
that month (use originationDate). Plot a graph to show the trend
5) Identify the loans which defaulted in this month (create a boolean column named defaultFlag) and then
calculate the percentage of defaulted loans
Defaulted loans are those which have not made any payment in this month (Hint: Refer to columns
beginningLoanBal and endingLoanBal)
6) What percentage of used vehicle loans that have a co-obligor (co-borrower) pay an interest rate of <=3%?
7) Which vehicle (Model name and year) is the most popular in Florida (obligorState = FL)?
8) Bucket the column obligorCreditScore into 5 buckets. Calculate the average default rate for each bucket and
plot a bar graph
Bonus Question: Please attempt only after attempting all the above questions
From the given data, estimate the vehicle value (col: vehicleValueAmount) using the Random Forest algorithm,
and report the accuracy of your model. We are concerned with data processing/cleaning, feature engineering and
selection, and how the problem is approached (especially the train/test methodology). Do not spend a lot of time
on tuning hyperparameters. More Information on Random Forest Regression here:

Guidelines for submission:
1. Please attempt all questions in a jupyter/ipython notebook, using comments/markup cells to show question
numbers at relevant places
2. If you have any questions, proceed by making necessary assumptions, explaining them clearly in the form of
comments/markup within the notebook itself
3. Place your code - ‘<YourName>_code.ipynb’ and a ‘.html’ export of the notebook - ‘<YourName>_code.html’
in a folder named ‘<YourName>_loan_data’ and zip it.
4. Your .zip file strictly should not strictly contain anything other than:
a. Your Resume
b. <YourName >_code.ipynb
c. <YourName >_code.html
5. Mail your .zip file to smarepa@frk.com and pratyushps@gmail.com
All the best!
